<h4>Day 1: Pocket camp is quite fun. In this new add on to the Animal faimly you are the new camp manager. Your job is to create a new campsite
while exploring the great outdoors of nature. While you explore you will run into other campers and campsites as well as new campsite members 
you can make friends with and ask to join your campsite. In order to make friends with them you must rasie your friendship levels with them by 
collecting items along the way such as: Fish, seashells, bugs and furits to give to them. Now,tho it soundslike alot to be it is really quite simple
and fun.By the end of the day i was already at level 4 and got Rosie as my first campsite member. I also earned a good bit of leaf tickets. Lucky me !

*If your wondering what leaf tickets are they currency introduced in Pocket Camp. 
They can be obtained by completing Timed Goals or Stretch Goals for Isabelle; or they may be bought for real-life currency. They are sold to you by Tom Nook.
Leaf Tickets are entirely optional, however, there are certain items and bonuses that are only attainable through using Leaf Tickets to purchase them.
 They can be used and exchanged for:</h4>

<h4>Day 2: Today I finally got to explore The OK Motors. OK Motors is a new location added in Pocket Camp, it's a place where players can customize their campers.
It is operated by Giovanni, who is the boss, and his employees Beppe and Carlo(who are his brothers). Players can change the style of their camper van, 
as well as the main body color and accent color. When you first get there they give you your first paint job for free. After that normal paint jobs cost 5,000 Bells
per paint job you want done. Special Designs can cost anywere from 8,000 to 10,000 Bells or 150 leaf tickets(a in game buyable currency ). There are also Expansion that you 
can get in order to upgrade your camper and they get a bit pricey of the back.</h4>

  <h4> Soo Today I learned more about how to bring more people to my camp site to day. What happens is in the game, you can chat with animal friends or fulfill requests to raise the friendship level with that villager. 
    The animal will come and visit you's campsite when their minimum required friendship level is reached, their required furniture is placed at you's campsite, and you calls them via the phone to invite them.
  you also has a level. This is raised by leveling up villagers. Each time a villager's friendship level is increased, a heart is added to you level progress. 
  For each new level, you will receive rewards that include unlocking more furniture or animals who may visit, as well as 1000 Bells and 10 Leaf Tickets.
   On levels that are multiples of 5, you receives an additional item, which may be a calling card, and/or a request card, and/or an additional market box slot. Welp that's all i have for now.
   Stay Tune floks :D !</h4>
